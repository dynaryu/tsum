"""
Subset Simulation (Au & Beck 2001) for TSUM rule extraction.

Implements a discrete-state variant of the component-wise Metropolis-Hastings
Subset Simulation originally developed for continuous reliability problems.

Key adaptations for TSUM's discrete multi-state components:

  1. Proposal: sticky independence proposal using the component marginal prior.
     For each component i independently, with probability beta keep the current
     state, else resample from prior_i. Because TSUM assumes independent
     components, the joint M-H acceptance ratio reduces to 1 and the effective
     acceptance becomes I(candidate in F_j). One sfun call per chain step.

  2. Severity: sfun returns (fval, sys_st, _). We define a transformed severity
     s = severity_sign * fval so that higher s always means "more failed". The
     level threshold b_j is the p0-quantile of seed severities.

  3. Termination: SuS levels halt as soon as every seed at the current level is
     an actual failure (sys_st < sys_surv_st). All collected failed samples are
     returned to the caller for rule minimisation.

This module is self-contained and is intended to be wired into
`run_rule_extraction_by_mcs` as an alternative search-phase sampler. The
unbiased probability estimation phase remains prior-based and is handled by the
caller.

    Au & Beck (2001) Subset Simulation search for failed states.

    Nested events F_1 supset F_2 supset ... supset F_M are defined by increasing
    thresholds on the transformed severity s = severity_sign * fval. At each
    level the top p0 fraction of samples by severity become the seeds for the
    next level, and `chain_length = round(1/p0)` CWM-H steps are taken per seed.

    The search terminates at the first level whose seeds are all actual
    failures (sys_st < sys_surv_st), when the level threshold becomes
    degenerate (no further progress possible), or when `max_levels` is
    reached.

    Note: this routine intentionally does NOT compute the SuS probability
    estimate p_F = p0^(M-1) * (n_fail_final / N). Unbiased probability
    estimation is the caller's responsibility (the run_rule_extraction_by_mcs
    main loop maintains a separate prior-based estimator).

        sys_surv_st:   minimum sys_st considered survival. sys_st < this is failure.
        n_per_level:   N, samples per level (Au & Beck use 1000).
        p0:            intermediate conditional probability (0.1 is standard).
        max_levels:    hard cap on number of SuS levels.
